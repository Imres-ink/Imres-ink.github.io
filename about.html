         <div class="p">Imre is a multimedia visual artist based in Delft. Throughout his life he has been inspired by his dynamic surroundings: the alleyways in Zaandam where he spend his early life, the 20th century-like house of his grandparents in the heart Budapest, the art made by his aunt Margit Lukacs and many other things. Within his art he shows how these places and things change and deform in his mind into mysterious places and scenes. With ink and paper more historical tones emerge, with digital painting and 3D art a sense of wonder and curiosity attracts you to the work. Often there is a story behind the art pieces, which you can explore by clicking on them on the main page.  </div>
            
            <div class="p">If you like the art and want to support me, you can buy his prints or posters on this site. You can also follow him on social media to get updates on the latest works and upcoming projects. Do you want to commission an original piece of art? You can send a mail to imrelukacsdesign@gmail.com. An average artwork takes around 10 hours, at a rate of â‚¬15 an hour. This rate is flexible depending on the project, some projects are simply worth working a little more on free of charge! 
                Thank you for visiting and take your time to take a look around.
