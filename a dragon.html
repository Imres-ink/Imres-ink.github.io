    <div class="p"> I started this drawing more like a sketch, trying out an interesting angle with a sweeping curve dividing the drawing (which became the staircase) above this curve I drew another curve for the dragon, not knowing what I was going for but just going with what felt right. The rest kind of grew on top of this start. I wanted to make something organic, something in between architecture and nature. This makes the hall look otherworldly and kind of cave-like. There are mushrooms growing on the higher pillars and enormous plants behind them. I vaguely had the Harry Potter scene of the dragon escaping from Gringotts bank in my mind while drawing. I imagined a dad bringing his kid to his work for a look around just when the dragon appeared out of on of the caves that lead to this central square. </div>
    
    <div class="p">   On the right you can see the drawing as it was just finished, on the balcony in Hungary where my family lives. It took up the whole page so I had to add more space around the edges in Photoshop to give it some room to “breathe”.
