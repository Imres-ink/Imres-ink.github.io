      My first real digital artwork
       </div>
     <div class="p">This art piece, “The Gnome and the Frog”, was the first time I spent more than a hundred hours on a digital painting. I drew it on my drawing tablet using photoshop as drawing software. As you can see on the right, I started of doing the linework. It was supposed to be just a small black and white drawing but I changed my mind and I’m really happy I did because it turned out magical. It’s serene and playful. Two small forest dwellers checking each other out when the cross paths in the tree canopy. The vibrant colors of the frog stand out to the muted greens and blues while the rain splashes around adding a bit of movement, as well as softening the light and bringing in reflections on the wet surfaces. </div>
     <div class="p">  I have since moved away a bit of this style but I’ve recently started with an art piece that has shifted a bit towards this. Nevertheless, this will stay a unique work of the early period of my art journey and you can buy it now on poster if you want to add a bit of fairytale mystique to your room.
